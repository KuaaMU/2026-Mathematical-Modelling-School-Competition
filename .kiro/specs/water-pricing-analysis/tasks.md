# Implementation Plan: Water Pricing Analysis

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the water pricing analysis design into executable coding tasks for Problems 3 and 4 of the mathematical modeling competition. The tasks build incrementally from data preparation through elasticity analysis to optimization and policy recommendations.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Set up project structure and data integration
- [ ] 2. Implement industrial water elasticity analysis
- [ ] 3. Implement residential water elasticity analysis
- [ ] 4. Implement comparative elasticity analysis
- [ ] 5. Checkpoint - Validate elasticity analysis results
- [ ] 6. Implement agricultural water pricing optimization
- [ ] 7. Implement Pareto frontier optimization
- [ ] 8. Implement tiered pricing scheme design
- [ ] 9. Implement policy recommendation system
- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive visualization and reporting
- [ ] 11. Integration and LaTeX output generation
- [ ] 12. Final checkpoint - Complete system validation
