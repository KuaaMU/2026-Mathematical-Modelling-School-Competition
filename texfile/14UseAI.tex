\section*{Report on Use of AI}

In accordance with the 2025 Mathematical Contest in Modeling guidelines, we declare the following use of AI tools in our research:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Kiro AI Assistant} (December 21, 2025 version, Claude-based)
\begin{description}
\item[Usage Context:] Code development, LaTeX formatting, and English language editing
\item[Specific Applications:] 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python code optimization for econometric analysis and multi-objective optimization
    \item LaTeX document structure and formatting assistance
    \item English language refinement and academic writing improvement
    \item Data visualization code generation and debugging
\end{itemize}
\item[Human Oversight:] All AI-generated code was thoroughly reviewed, tested, and modified by team members. All mathematical models, economic interpretations, and policy recommendations were developed independently by the team.
\end{description}

\item \textbf{GitHub Copilot} (December 2025 version)
\begin{description}
\item[Usage Context:] Code completion and syntax assistance
\item[Specific Applications:] 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Autocomplete for standard Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy)
    \item Boilerplate code generation for data processing functions
    \item Syntax suggestions for optimization algorithms
\end{itemize}
\item[Human Oversight:] All suggestions were manually reviewed and integrated only when appropriate for our specific analysis requirements.
\end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Declaration of Original Work:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All mathematical modeling approaches and methodological choices were made independently by the team
    \item Economic analysis, policy interpretations, and conclusions are entirely our own work
    \item Data analysis design and results interpretation were conducted without AI assistance
    \item The multi-objective optimization framework and elasticity analysis methodology were developed by team members
    \item All critical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and academic insights represent original human work
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Ethical Use Statement:}
We used AI tools as assistive technologies to enhance productivity and presentation quality, while maintaining full intellectual ownership of the research design, analysis, and conclusions. No AI tool was used to replace human judgment in model selection, parameter interpretation, or policy recommendation development.
