\subsection{Residential Water Price Elasticity}

Residential water analysis reveals fundamentally different demand characteristics:
$$\ln(Q_{residential}) = \alpha + \beta_1 \ln(P_{water}) + \beta_2 \ln(Income) + \varepsilon$$

\subsubsection{Key Findings}

Residential water shows inelastic demand with price elasticity of -0.107 (not significant, p=0.430), but significant income elasticity of 0.351 (p<0.05). This indicates residential consumption responds more to income changes than price changes.

\subsubsection{Economic Mechanisms}

Low price elasticity reflects: (1) Essential nature of basic water needs, (2) Habit dependency in consumption patterns, (3) Limited substitution possibilities, and (4) Small share of household budget (<2\%). Income elasticity dominance suggests water is a normal good with consumption increasing alongside economic development.
