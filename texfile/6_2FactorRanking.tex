Since the dataset is small (17 samples), we utilized Grey Relational Analysis
(GRA) to evaluate the correlation strength of macro-drivers. The results (Figure X-Left)
indicate that Population (GRA=0.965) has a significantly higher correlation with water
usage than GDP (GRA=0.556). This suggests that demographic expansion aligns more closely
with the historical trend of water demand.
