\subsection{Policy Recommendations}

\subsubsection{Short-term Measures (2025-2026)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Industrial Water}: Pilot tiered pricing in Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, launching Q1 2025, with 15\% base price increase (from 3.5 to 4.0 yuan/m$^3$)
    \item \textbf{Agricultural Water}: Pilot our tiered pricing scheme in North China Plain, with concurrent 50 yuan/acre water conservation subsidies
    \item \textbf{Monitoring System}: Establish national water resource monitoring platform for real-time consumption tracking
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Medium-term Planning (2027-2029)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Water Rights Trading}: Establish inter-provincial water rights trading market, allowing surplus water quota trading at 2.0-5.0 yuan/m$^3$
    \item \textbf{Technology Promotion}: Central government investment of 20 billion yuan for efficient irrigation technology, targeting 80\% farmland coverage by 2029
    \item \textbf{Legal Framework}: Revise Water Law to establish legal basis for agricultural water pricing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Long-term Mechanism (2030+)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Water Resource GDP}: Incorporate water consumption into local government performance evaluation, establish "Water Resource GDP" accounting system
    \item \textbf{Ecological Compensation}: Create watershed ecological compensation mechanism where upstream water-saving regions receive downstream compensation
    \item \textbf{Climate Adaptation}: Integrate climate change impacts into water resource planning, establish flexible water price adjustment mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Priorities}

Based on our elasticity analysis and optimization results, we recommend the following priority sequence:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Highest Priority - Industrial Sector}: Implement price-based policies immediately due to high elasticity (-0.495)
    \item \textbf{Medium Priority - Agricultural Sector}: Deploy optimized pricing scheme with strong support measures
    \item \textbf{Lower Priority - Residential Sector}: Focus on education and tiered pricing rather than aggressive price increases
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Financial Sustainability}

\textbf{Revenue Generation}: Estimated additional revenue of 15-20 billion yuan annually from optimized pricing
\textbf{Investment Requirements}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Infrastructure: 50 billion yuan over 5 years
    \item Subsidies: 8 billion yuan annually
    \item Technology: 20 billion yuan over 3 years
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Net Benefit}: Positive cash flow expected by year 3 of implementation

% =============== Writing Guidelines ===============
% 1. Organize by short/medium/long-term phases
% 2. Each recommendation must include specific numbers (amounts, percentages, timelines)
% 3. Must include implementation roadmap (Gantt chart)
% 4. Priority: pilot first, then scale up
% 5. Consider fiscal feasibility (avoid unrealistic investment suggestions)
