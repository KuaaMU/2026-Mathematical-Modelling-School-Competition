\subsection{Industrial Water Price Elasticity}

Industrial water price elasticity analysis employs a log-linear demand model:
$$\ln(Q_{industrial}) = \alpha + \beta_1 \ln(P_{water}) + \beta_2 \ln(GDP_{industrial}) + \varepsilon$$

\subsubsection{Key Findings}

OLS estimation yields significant price elasticity of -0.495 (p<0.01), indicating elastic demand. The industrial water price elasticity demonstrates strong responsiveness to price changes, with a 10\% price increase reducing consumption by approximately 5.0\%.

\subsubsection{Economic Mechanisms}

The high industrial elasticity reflects: (1) Efficiency-forcing mechanism through technology investment, (2) Technical substitution opportunities via recycling, (3) Cost sensitivity affecting competitiveness, and (4) Market competition pressure for cost control.
