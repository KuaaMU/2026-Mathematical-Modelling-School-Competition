\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\subsubsection{Historical Water Consumption Trends}

National water consumption exhibits three distinct phases: rapid growth (2000-2007), transition with policy interventions (2008-2012), and stabilization around 600 billion m³ (2013-2016).

\subsubsection{Correlation Analysis}

Key relationships reveal economic development patterns driving water consumption:

Strong GDP-water correlation (r=0.89) with diminishing intensity over time indicates potential for decoupling economic growth from water consumption through efficiency improvements and structural transformation.
