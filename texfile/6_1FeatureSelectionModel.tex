To understand the dynamics of water consumption, we first decomposed the total water
usage into four sectors: Agricultural, Industrial, Domestic, and Ecological. As shown
in Figure X, Agricultural water consistently accounts for the largest share ( > 60\%),
while Industrial water usage shows a stabilizing trend. However, these are compositional
parts, not external drivers.
