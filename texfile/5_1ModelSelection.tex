\subsection{Ensemble Model Development}

Given the small sample size ($N=17$, 2000-2016) and non-exponential trend characteristics, we developed a weighted ensemble combining ARIMA and polynomial regression models.

\subsubsection{Model Selection Rationale}
The data exhibits: (1) Small sample size unsuitable for deep learning, (2) Non-exponential "saturation" trend after 2013, and (3) Strong autocorrelation. We selected ARIMA(1,1,0) for capturing temporal dependencies and quadratic polynomial regression for the global trend.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Framework}

We developed a weighted ensemble combining ARIMA(1,1,0) and quadratic polynomial regression:

**ARIMA Model**: Captures short-term fluctuations through autoregressive structure
**Polynomial Model**: Captures long-term saturation trend  
**Ensemble Prediction**: $\hat{Y}_{final} = 0.70 \cdot \hat{Y}_{ARIMA} + 0.30 \cdot \hat{Y}_{Poly}$

Weights were optimized based on validation performance (2013-2016), prioritizing ARIMA's stability while retaining polynomial's trend-capturing capability.
